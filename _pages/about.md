Hi!

I'm a software developer at Softree Technical Systems where I work on a variety of modelling-based projects related to road design.

I received my MSc. in mathematics from UBC - Okanagan, working with Dr. Yves Lucet and Dr. Warren Hare.
My research focused on using regularization for continuous optimization in road design applications.
I am grateful to have been partially funded by the [FRQNT](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/nature-and-technologies/) B1X scholarship.

I completed my joint BSc. at McGill in mathematics and computer science.
During my studies, I mainly worked in the [Oberman Lab](https://adamoberman.net/oberman-lab.html) with a handful of great researchers to whom I am indebted to.

Some non-academic activities that I enjoy are cycling, skiing and badminton.
